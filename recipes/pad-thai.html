    <ol>
        <li> Cook rice noodles according to package directions, drain, rinse under cold water; set aside. </li>
        <li> To a very large skillet at least 4 inches deep, add the oils (vegetable and/or olive oil may be substituted for the sesame and coconut oil), onion, and sauté the onion over medium-high heat for about 5 minutes, or until onion is beginning to soften; stir intermittently.
        </li>
        <li> Add the chicken and cook for about 3 minutes, or until done; stir and flip nearly constantly to ensure even cooking. The chicken will cook very quickly if it’s sliced sufficiently thin. </li>

        <li> Add the cabbage, carrots, soy sauce, fish sauce, lime juice, stir to combine, cover skillet with a lid, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer for about 3 minutes, or until cabbage wilts and softens. Remove lid and stir. </li>
        <li>Add the honey and stir to combine. </li>
        <li>Add the cooked noodles, turn off the heat, and stir well to combine. </li>
        <li>Add the scrambled egg, optional sriracha, and stir to combine. </li>
        <li> Evenly garnish with the green onions, peanuts, and serve.
